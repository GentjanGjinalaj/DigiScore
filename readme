Twitter is still down so you will not get data from it
Linkedin and Facebook depend on an online scrapper on a free trial and on total we have only 50 request per month in total for both so 25 each and divide that by 6 competitors. I am waiting to get 10000 free API credits because i did a review on them.
After all the API credits will finish you will have no more data for facebook or linkedin unles you upgrade to premium or create another free account and repeat the same proces.

A log file that saves every detail from the runs is available called appp.log
